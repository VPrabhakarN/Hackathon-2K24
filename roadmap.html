              <h4 class="mb-3"><b>Core Java Concepts</b></h4>
              <p> Fundamental understanding of core Java concepts is crucial. This includes knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Additionally proficiency in handling data types, operators, control structures, and exception handling is essential Interviewers often assess candidates' grasp of Java's syntax and language features.</p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 pt-3"><b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b></h4>
              <p>Strong proficiency in data structures and algorithms is a key aspect of Java development interviews. Candidates should demonstrate proficiency in implementing and utilizing common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash maps. Moreover, they should be adept at algorithmic problem-solving techniques like searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming.</p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 pt-3"><b>Multi-Threading and Concurrency</b></h4>
              <p>Java's support for multi-threading and concurrency is another important area of focus in interviews. Candidates should be familiar with concepts such as threads, synchronization, locks, and concurrent collections. Understanding potential issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and thread safety is crucial. Moreover, knowledge of Java's concurrency utilities like the Executor framework and concurrent data structures is beneficial.</p>
